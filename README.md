<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a rather simple Python script which makes use of Selenium's ability
to interact with the web browser to create a sophisticated bot capable of solving
most questions with absolute precision.

This project was forked to maintain the original project which had outdated dependencies.

Some awesome features:
* Lightweight
* Runs in the background
* Solves nearly all questions
* Multi threaded
* Gain 25 million points per day (On 8 Threads)
* Instant setup and configurable

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

This is a list of configurable options in the `config.json` file and what they mean.

| Configurable             | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Default | Datatype |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `lastProcessedArticleID` | Saves the last processed article ID to prevent repeated processing. Do not modify this unless you know what you are doing.                                                   | 14      | int      |
| `articlesPerSession`     | Number of articles the script will process every time you run it. Once it processes that many articles, it will stop and exit.                                               | 100     | int      |
| `threads`                | Number of threads to run. More threads means that the script will be able to solve more articles concurrently, but will also use more system resources.                      | 4       | int      | 
| `headless`               | If set to true, the browser will be invisible which increases performance. It is recommended to turn this on for quicker solving, especially when multiple threads are used. | false   | bool     |
